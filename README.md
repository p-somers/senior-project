==============

A couple of examples of php scripts I wrote for my senior project.

The project's aim was to have a database that looked at various variables of things around the world that might have an effect on or be indicative of global events as reported in the news. For our project, we used dow/nasdaq values, the price of a barrel of oil, and presidential approval/disapproval.

The server would also get the day's news events from the AP, and store the most popular words along with their frequency count. We also planned to store the URLs to the stories but ran out of time.

The idea was that we would have a database to look for correlations in, and be able to find days/weeks in history with similar trends between indicators. We'd look at the news stories for that week in the past, and see if they matched up with current events.

At the end of senior year, we had the system up and running with a good-looking front and a solid server that logged indicator values in the database every midnight, and concluded that the next step for any future students who carried on the project would be to start implementing systems for analyzing the data.

I've included most of the php scripts that I, Peter Somers, worked on.
